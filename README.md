# Map-Coloring-using-Backtracking-Search
While creating the application, I used CSV reading to transfer the file data to the application. As a first step, I gave the file name as a parameter in the **readData** function. Then, using the numpy library, I created a zero matrix in the row and column as size of **countries** list. I read the file line by line and compared the countries from the file data with the **countries** list. According to the file data, I converted the neighboring regions to 1 value in the matrix. Later I defined a dictionary called **areaColors**.
Then I called the **mapColoring** function for each element of the list **countries** for map coloring with using backtracking search. Here I enumerate the colors first. Then, in **mapColoring**, I called the **check** function, which first verifies the neighbors of the region according to the value 1 I assigned in the zero matrix, and then controls the colors of the region and its neighbors. The **check** function returns true for different colors, false for the same colors. The region is colored with the **true** value coming from the **check** function. Visualization is done with the **plot_choropleth** function, which takes parameters in the dictionary that we created as **areaColors**.
